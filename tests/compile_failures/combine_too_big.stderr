error[E0277]: the trait bound `u8: From<u16>` is not satisfied
 --> tests/compile_failures/combine_too_big.rs:5:5

5 |     combinebits!("aaaa aaaa");
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `From<u16>` is not implemented for `u8`
  |
  = help: the following other types implement trait `From<T>`:
            <u8 as From<Char>>
            <u8 as From<bool>>
  = note: this error originates in the macro `combinebits` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
